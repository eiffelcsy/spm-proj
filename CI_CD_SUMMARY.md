## 🎯 Pipeline Features

### 1. **test.yml** - Main Test Suite

**Triggers**: 
- Push to: `main`, `master`, `develop`, `refactoring`
- Pull requests to above branches

**Features**:
✅ **Multi-version testing** (Node.js 18.x & 20.x)
✅ **Parallel job execution** (test, lint, build)
✅ **Coverage generation** and upload
✅ **Codecov integration** (optional)
✅ **PR coverage comments** (automatic)
✅ **Artifact uploads** (30-day retention)

**Jobs**:
1. `test` - Runs all unit tests on multiple Node versions
2. `lint` - Linting checks (placeholder, ready to add)
3. `build` - Production build verification

---

### 2. **coverage-report.yml** - Coverage Analysis

**Triggers**:
- Push to: `main`, `master`
- Pull requests to above branches

**Features**:
✅ **Detailed coverage reports** (HTML, JSON, LCOV)
✅ **Coverage summary** in job output
✅ **Automatic warnings** if coverage < 80%
✅ **Codecov upload** with full history
✅ **30-day artifact retention**

**Outputs**:
- Coverage percentage displayed in job summary
- Interactive HTML report as artifact
- LCOV file for external tools

---

### 3. **pr-checks.yml** - PR Automation

**Triggers**:
- All pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)

**Features**:
✅ **Automated test execution** on PR code
✅ **Test result extraction** (passed/failed counts)
✅ **Auto-commenting** on PRs with results
✅ **Smart comment updates** (no spam)
✅ **14-day artifact retention**
✅ **Fail PR** if tests don't pass

**PR Comment Format**:
```markdown
## ✅ Test Results

**Status**: ✅ All tests passed!

- **Passed**: 37

## 📊 Complete Workflow Matrix

| Workflow | Push Main | Push Branch | PR | Node Versions | Duration |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----|--------------| ---------|
| test.yml | ✅ | ✅* | ✅ | 18.x, 20.x | ~3-5 min |
| coverage-report.yml | ✅ | ❌ | ✅** | 20.x | ~2-3 min |
| pr-checks.yml | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | 20.x | ~2-3 min |

\* Only specific branches: main, master, develop, refactoring  
\** Only PRs to main/master

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### On Every Push to Main Branches

```
1. GitHub detects push
2. test.yml triggers
3. Checks out code
4. Installs dependencies (npm ci)
5. Runs tests on Node 18.x
6. Runs tests on Node 20.x
7. Generates coverage (Node 20.x only)
8. Uploads to Codecov (if configured)
9. Uploads artifacts
10. Reports success/failure
```

### On Every Pull Request

```
1. GitHub detects PR creation/update
2. All 3 workflows trigger
3. Tests run in parallel
4. Results extracted automatically
5. PR comment posted/updated
6. Coverage badge updated (if Codecov)
7. Status checks appear in PR
8. PR blocked if tests fail (with branch protection)
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Coverage Thresholds

Set in `vitest.config.ts`:
```typescript
coverage: {
  lines: 80%,
  functions: 80%,
  branches: 80%,
  statements: 80%
}
```

Enforced in `coverage-report.yml`:
```yaml
if [ "$COVERAGE" -lt 80 ]; then
  echo "::warning::Coverage is below 80%"
fi
```

### Artifact Retention

| Artifact | Workflow | Retention |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| coverage-report | test.yml | 30 days |
| build-output | test.yml | 7 days |
| coverage-report | coverage-report.yml | 30 days |
| pr-coverage-report | pr-checks.yml | 14 days |

### Node.js Caching

All workflows use npm caching:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20.x'
    cache: 'npm'  # Speeds up subsequent runs
```

---

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### 1. **Smart PR Comments**

- Updates existing comment instead of creating new ones
- Shows pass/fail status with emojis
- Includes test counts (passed/failed/total)
- Links to coverage artifacts
- No comment spam!

### 2. **Multi-Node Testing**

Tests run on both Node.js 18.x and 20.x to ensure compatibility:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
```

### 3. **Parallel Job Execution**

Jobs run in parallel for faster feedback:
- Test job (with matrix) = 2 parallel runs
- Lint job = Independent
- Build job = Independent

Total parallel jobs: Up to 4 simultaneously!

### 4. **Continue on Error**

Coverage upload failures don't fail the entire workflow:
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage
  continue-on-error: true
```

### 5. **Conditional Steps**

Some steps only run under specific conditions:
```yaml
if: matrix.node-version == '20.x'  # Only on Node 20
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'  # Only on PRs
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Successful Run

```
✅ Run Tests (Node 18.x) - 3m 15s
✅ Run Tests (Node 20.x) - 3m 22s
✅ Lint Check - 1m 05s
✅ Build Check - 2m 30s
✅ Generate Coverage Report - 2m 45s
✅ PR Test Suite - 2m 50s

All checks passed!
```

### With Test Failures

```
❌ Run Tests (Node 18.x) - 3m 20s
   → 5 tests failed

❌ Run Tests (Node 20.x) - 3m 25s
   → 5 tests failed

✅ Lint Check - 1m 05s
✅ Build Check - 2m 30s
❌ PR Test Suite - 2m 55s
   → Tests failed, PR cannot be merged

Some checks failed
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup (One Time)

1. **Commit workflow files**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"
   git push origin refactoring
   ```

2. **Enable Actions** (if not already):
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Actions → General
   - Allow all actions

3. **Set up Codecov** (optional):
   - Sign up at codecov.io
   - Get repository token
   - Add as `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

4. **Enable branch protection** (recommended):
   - Settings → Branches
   - Add rule for `main`
   - Require status checks to pass

### Daily Usage

**Just work normally!**

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin your-branch

# Create PR
# → CI runs automatically
# → Results appear in PR
# → Status checks show pass/fail
```

**That's it!** No manual commands needed.
