# Task Comments Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive commenting system to tasks, allowing users to add, edit, and delete comments on tasks they have access to.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Requirements
- **Author Display**: Each comment shows the author's name and avatar
- **Timestamp Display**: Comments show creation time with relative formatting (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")
- **Chronological Order**: Comments are displayed oldest to newest
- **Multiple Comments**: Users can add multiple comments to the same task
- **Character Limit**: 2000 character limit enforced on both frontend and backend
- **No Nesting**: Comments are flat (no replies to comments)
- **Dedicated Section**: Comments appear in a dedicated section on the task detail page
- **Edit Comments**: Users can edit their own comments
- **Delete Comments**: Users can delete their own comments (admins can delete any)

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Backend API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks/[id]/comments` - Fetch all comments for a task
- `POST /api/tasks/[id]/comments` - Create a new comment
- `PUT /api/tasks/[id]/comments/[commentId]` - Update a comment
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]/comments/[commentId]` - Delete a comment (soft delete)

#### Frontend Components
- `TaskComments.vue` - Main comments component with full CRUD functionality
- `DeleteCommentDialog.vue` - Custom styled delete confirmation dialog
- Integrated into task detail page (`/app/pages/task/[id].vue`)

#### Database Schema
Uses existing `task_comments` table:
- `id` - Primary key
- `task_id` - Foreign key to tasks table
- `staff_id` - Foreign key to staff table (comment author)
- `content` - Comment text (max 2000 chars)
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last modification timestamp
- `deleted_at` - Soft deletion timestamp

#### Permissions
- **View Comments**: Users can view comments on tasks they created or are assigned to
- **Add Comments**: Same as view permissions
- **Edit Comments**: Users can only edit their own comments
- **Delete Comments**: Users can delete their own comments, admins can delete any

#### UI/UX Features
- **Real-time Character Count**: Shows current/max characters while typing
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to submit comments
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during API calls
- **Empty States**: Friendly message when no comments exist
- **Edit Mode**: Inline editing with save/cancel options
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Confirms before deleting comments
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to any task detail page
2. Scroll to the "Comments" section
3. Type a comment in the text area (max 2000 characters)
4. Click "Add Comment" or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
5. Edit your comments using the dropdown menu (three dots)
6. Delete comments using the dropdown menu

### For Developers
The commenting system is fully integrated and requires no additional setup. The components are:
- `TaskComments` - Main component (imported from `@/components/comment-modals`)
- `DeleteCommentDialog` - Custom styled delete confirmation dialog
- All necessary API endpoints are already implemented
- TypeScript types are defined in `~/types`

                â”œâ”€â”€ index.post.ts     # Create comment
                â”œâ”€â”€ [commentId].put.ts    # Update comment
                â””â”€â”€ [commentId].delete.ts # Delete comment
```

## Testing
The implementation has been tested for:
- âœ… Comment creation with character limits
- âœ… Comment editing and saving
- âœ… Comment deletion with confirmation
- âœ… Permission checks (only own comments can be edited/deleted)
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Loading states and error handling
- âœ… Integration with existing task detail page

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements that could be added:
- Comment notifications
- @mentions in comments
- Comment reactions/emojis
- Rich text formatting
- File attachments in comments
- Comment search functionality
